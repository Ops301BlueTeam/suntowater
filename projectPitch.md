# Project Pitch

## Ideas

After looking at the perameters for the project we decided to each take a stab at writing the script required.  By uploading different versions of the script we can then collaborate on the best avenue to tackle the requested feature.

Offering the client multiple options for the implementation of their IT needs was a priority. This requires multiple cost outlines for potential solutions.  

Several versions of VPN tunneling were also looked at and the pros and con's weighed. The final solution will be made as a group before the solution is finalized.

It was settled that after a working VM model is achieved the VM's will be uploaded and each member of the team will download them in order to ensure it is available for presentation day.
